Source for tutorial on generating .emf file: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/ArmA:_Cheats#TOPOGRAPHY

This guide assumes you have the program OSGeo4W installed.
(https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)

1. 	Run Arma 3 as Administrator (right click on arma3.exe > Run as administrator).

2. 	Open desired map in 2D editor (does not work in 3D editor).
	Note: 2D editor can be accessed by pressing Ctrl + O on map selection screen.

3. 	Press Left Shift + Numpad Minus (-).
	Release both keys and then blindly type EXPORTNOGRID.
	An "Activated EXPORTNOGRID" message should (very briefly) appear.

4.	Go to C:\ and check for <worldname>.emf. If no file is found, make sure you followed step 1.
 	Close Arma 3 (important).

5. 	Download BI Tools (https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/BI_Tools_2.5)
	and locate EmfToPng.exe  (in Visitor 3 folder).
	Copy EmfToPng.exe to a place you have write access (without need to run as administrator).

6. 	Copy <worldname>.emf (from step 4) to same folder as where we just copied EmfToPng.exe.
	Create a shortcut of EmfToPng.exe that launches with arguments: <worldname>.emf N
	
	N is the zoom level. We want to find the N which results in an image with dimensions that adheres to
	the tile size chart (see below). This may take some experimenting and will vary between maps.
	N is usually somewhere between 0.1 and 2. The recommended target is 16384.
	A good place to start is N=1. From there, calculate which zoom level is needed to adhere
	to tile size chart.
	e.g. If N=1 results in image size of 20480, and we want zoom level 6 (16384), then we'd do
	16384/20480 = 0.8 = N
	
	Note: The resulting image dimensions (both X and Y) must equal *exactly* 16384.
	If the dimensions of the image are not even, you will need to trim the image using an image editing
	program such as Photoshop or GIMP (free). Crop the image to remove any black borders/edges so that the
	resulting image has equal dimensions. You *must* ensure that any antialiasing features are disabled when
	doing this:
		- In Photoshop, use the select tool and NOT the crop tool.
		- In GIMP, use the crop tool.

7. 	Run shortcut and wait until .emf is converted to a .png

8. 	Drag and drop <worldname>.png into OSGeo4W64 directory.
	Launch OSGeo4W64.bat and enter the followig command:
	gdal2tiles_legacy_no-tms -p raster -z 0-6 <worldname>.png
	(assuming your image size is 16384 - zoom level 6)

	Note: gdal2tiles_legacy_no-tms is a modified version of gdal2tiles.
	To install, just drag the included gdal2tiles_legacy_no-tms .py and .bat
	files into OSGeo4W64\bin\.
	
If you wish to submit your tileset to be added to the OCAP map repository, please archive the folder
into a .tar file and upload somewhere (e.g. Dropbox). Ensure the name of the folder matches the
name of the terrian, and is in lowercase (e.g. isladuala3). Then please submit it via this GitHub ticket:
https://github.com/mistergoodson/OCAP/issues/34
You must include details on:
	- World name (e.g. Stratis)
	- Image size (size of image used to create tiles, e.g. 16384)
	- World size (size of image when N=1). Note: Please do not rely on the 'worldSize' value in Arma.
	- Multiplier (value of N)
Ideally, please provide info in the following example format:
{
	"name": "Isla Duala 3",
	"worldName": "isladuala3",
	"worldSize": 10240,
	"imageSize": 16384,
	"multiplier": 1.6
}

// Run the below code in the debug console to extract metadata on currently loaded maps.
_worlds = "true" configClasses (configFile >> "CfgWorldList");
worldArray = [];
{
	_x = configFile >> "CfgWorlds" >> (configName _x);
	worldArray pushBack [configName _x, getText (_x >> "description")];
} forEach _worlds;
copyToClipBoard str worldArray;

// Example output
["isladuala3","Isla Duala 3"] // Map config name, map display name
